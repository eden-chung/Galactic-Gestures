# Galactic-Gestures

This project involves developing a real-time gesture detection and classification algorithm to control the classic game *Space Invaders* through live video feed. Weâ€™ll design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the model architecture to accurately classify hand gesture directions, enabling intuitive, gesture-based gameplay. 

We will be using [fernandozamoraj's Space Invaders](https://github.com/fernandozamoraj/processing_sandbox/tree/master/SpaceInvaders) game. We will add our real-time gesture detection model as the main input for the player's movement. 

How to play:

1. Point right: player will move right
2. Point left: player will move left
3.
